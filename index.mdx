## What is Teta?

Teta is an AI-powered development platform specifically optimized for **Flutter development**. Build mobile, web, and desktop applications with the power of AI while maintaining full control over your code through GitHub.

## Key Features

### 🤖 AI Optimized for Flutter
- **Flutter-First**: AI specifically trained and optimized for Flutter and Dart development
- **Cloud Environment**: Development environment pre-configured with Flutter SDK and Dart tools
- **Intelligent Assistant**: AI that understands Flutter widgets, state management, and best practices
- **Custom AI Agents**: Create specialized agents for your specific coding standards and workflows

### 🔐 Privacy & Security
- **Your Code, Your Repository**: Teta never stores your codebase on its servers
- **GitHub-Powered**: All code lives in your GitHub repository
- **Secure Sandboxes**: Code is cloned into isolated, secure development environments
- **Full Control**: You own and control all your code and data

### 🔄 Safe Development Workflow
- **Protected Main Branch**: AI never works directly on main/master branches
- **Feature Branches**: All changes happen on dedicated feature branches
- **Review Process**: Review all AI changes on GitHub before merging
- **Pull Requests**: Create PRs directly from Teta for team collaboration
- **Version Control**: Complete Git history of all changes

### 🎨 Live Preview While Coding
- **Real-Time Updates**: See your app running as the AI makes changes
- **Hot Reload**: Instant UI updates without rebuilding (Flutter)
- **Hot Restart**: Quick app restarts for logic changes
- **Multiple Device Modes**: Test on phone, tablet, and desktop views
- **Integrated Console**: Monitor logs and errors in real-time

### 🔧 Extensibility & Customization
- **MCP Servers**: Connect external tools and services (databases, APIs, etc.)
- **Custom Integrations**: Add your own MCP servers for specific needs
- **Built-in Tools**: Supabase, Dart documentation, and more out of the box
- **Team Agents**: Share AI configurations across your team

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Project

1. Click on **"New Project"** from the dashboard
2. Choose your project type: **Flutter** or **Svelte**
3. Connect your **GitHub repository**
4. Wait for the workspace to initialize

### 2. Connect GitHub

GitHub integration is required for all projects:

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub**
2. Install the Teta GitHub App
3. Select the repository you want to use
4. Grant necessary permissions

> **Note**: Teta will create a dedicated working branch (`teta/app-*`) to protect your main branch.

### 3. Start Building with AI

Once your workspace is ready:

1. **Chat with AI**: Describe what you want to build in natural language
   ```
   "Create a login screen with email and password fields"
   "Add a user profile page with avatar and bio"
   ```

2. **Watch AI Code**: The AI makes changes directly in your feature branch
   - All modifications are committed to Git
   - Changes are isolated from your main branch

3. **See Live Preview**: Your app updates in real-time as the AI codes
   - Preview window shows the running app
   - Hot reload applies changes instantly
   - Test on different device sizes

4. **Review & Merge**: When satisfied with the changes:
   - Review the diff on GitHub
   - Create a pull request
   - Merge into your main branch

### 4. Deploy Your App

When you're ready to share:

1. Click the **"Publish"** button in the navbar
2. Your app will be deployed to a Teta domain (`*.teta.sh`)
3. Share the link with anyone!
4. (Optional) Connect your custom domain

## Credits & Pricing

Teta uses a credit-based system:

- **Teta Starter plan (Free)**: 5 messages/day, 30 messages/month
- **Teta Pro plan**: 5x Starter plan usage
- **Teta Max Plan**: 4x Pro plan usage

> **Tip**: The platform automatically chooses the best model for your task to optimize credit usage!
