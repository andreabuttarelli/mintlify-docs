## What are Integrations?

Integrations in Teta are powered by **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**. Think of them as plugins that connect the Teta AI to your existing tools and workflows.

By integrating Teta with your services, the AI can:
- 📖 **Read context** from your documentation, tickets, and design files.
- ✍️ **Perform actions** like creating tickets, updating statuses, or sending notifications.
- 🧠 **Become more knowledgeable** about your projects, leading to more accurate and relevant outputs.

This turns Teta from a code generator into a true AI assistant that understands your team's context and workflows.

## Available Integrations

Here are some of the pre-built integrations you can use with Teta:

### Collaboration and Project Management

| Integration | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Linear**](./linear-integration.md) | Connect to your Linear workspace to turn issues into prototypes and keep your projects in sync. |
| [**Atlassian (Jira & Confluence)**](./atlassian-integration.md) | Integrate with Jira to manage tickets and Confluence to access your team's knowledge base. |
| [**Notion**](./notion-integration.md) | Use your Notion workspaces as a source of context for the AI. |
| [**Slack**](./slack-integration.md) | Send notifications, messages, and interact with your team in Slack. |

### Databases and Data Sources

| Integration | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Supabase**](./mcp-servers.md#supabase-mcp-server) | Query your Supabase database and read schema information. |
| [**PostgreSQL**](./mcp-servers.md#postgresql-server) | Connect to any PostgreSQL database to read data and schemas. |

### Web and Development

| Integration | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**GitHub**](./github-integration.md) | Integrate with your GitHub repositories for version control and code management. |
| [**Brave Search**](./mcp-servers.md#brave-search-server) | Provide the AI with web search capabilities for real-time information. |
| [**Puppeteer**](./mcp-servers.md#puppeteer-server) | Automate browser tasks, scrape websites, and capture screenshots. |

## How to Add an Integration

Most integrations are added by configuring a corresponding MCP server in your project settings.

1.  **Find the integration** you want to add from the list above.
2.  **Follow the setup instructions** in the integration's documentation.
3.  Typically, this involves:
    *   Generating an API key or token from the third-party service.
    *   Adding a new MCP server configuration in **Settings > MCPs**.
    *   Storing any sensitive tokens as Teta secrets.

## Custom Integrations

If you don't see an integration you need, you can build your own. MCP is an open standard, and you can create a custom server for any internal or third-party tool.

- **Learn more about custom MCP servers in the [MCP Servers documentation](./mcp-servers.md).**

## Security

When connecting third-party tools, it's important to follow security best practices:
- **Use dedicated tokens** with the minimum required permissions.
- **Never expose secrets** in your code; use Teta's secret management.
- **Review permissions** regularly and revoke access when no longer needed.
