title: "Agent Mode"
description: "Autonomous AI coding agent that independently explores, plans, and executes complex codebase changes with full tools"
---

Agent is the default and most autonomous mode in Teta, designed to handle complex coding tasks with minimal guidance. It has all **tools** enabled to autonomously explore your codebase, read documentation, browse the web, edit files, and run terminal commands to complete tasks efficiently.

## **Agent’s Capabilities**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Autonomous Operation">
    Independently explores your codebase, identifies relevant files, and makes necessary changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Tool Access">
    Uses all available tools to search, edit, create files, and run terminal commands
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contextual Understanding">
    Builds a comprehensive understanding of your project structure and dependencies
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-step Planning">
    Breaks complex tasks into manageable steps and executes them in sequence
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## **Agent’s Workflow**

Much like a human, Agent mode follows a systematic approach to completing tasks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand Request">
    Agent mode analyzes your request, and the context of the codebase to fully comprehend the task requirements and goals.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Codebase">
    The agent may search through your codebase, documentation, and the web to identify relevant files and understand the current implementation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Changes">
    Based on the analysis, the agent breaks down the task into smaller steps and plans the changes, learning from the available context as it goes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Changes">
    The agent makes the necessary code modifications according to the plan across your entire codebase, also potentially suggesting new libraries, terminal commands to run or steps you should make outside of Teta.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Results">
    The agent will confirm the changes look correct after being made by applying them. If it notices any issues or linter errors (when supported by the language), it will attempt to fix them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Task Complete">
    Once the agent is happy, it yields back and summarizes the changes it made.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Agent mode creates stores any changes in internal commits, allowing you to revert if needed.\
