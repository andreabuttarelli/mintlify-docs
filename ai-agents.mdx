## What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are specialized AI assistants with custom instructions (prompts) that help you:

- Enforce coding standards and best practices
- Follow specific architectural patterns
- Generate code in a particular style
- Handle domain-specific tasks
- Automate repetitive workflows
- They have their own context window

## Creating AI Agents

### Personal Agents

Personal agents are available only to you across all your projects.

**To create a personal agent:**

1. **Main Sidebar** > **Agents**
2. Click **"New"**
3. Fill in the agent details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "flutter-best-practices")
   - **Description**: What this agent does
   - **Prompt**: Detailed instructions for the AI

4. Click **"Save"**

### Team Agents

Team agents are shared across all members of your team and team projects.

**To create a team agent:**

1. Navigate to your **Team Settings**
2. Go to **Agents** section
3. Click **"New"**
4. Configure the agent (same fields as personal agents)
5. Click **"Save"**

> **Note**: Team agents take precedence over personal agents in team projects.

## Agent Configuration

### Writing Effective Prompts

A good agent prompt should:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the agent's purpose
2. **Include Examples**: Show desired output format
3. **Set Constraints**: Define what to do and what to avoid
4. **Establish Context**: Explain the project type and requirements

#### Example Agent Prompts

**Flutter Clean Architecture Agent:**

```markdown
You are a Flutter development expert specializing in Clean Architecture.

When generating code:
- Always follow Clean Architecture principles (Domain, Data, Presentation layers)
- Use BLoC pattern for state management
- Create separate files for models, repositories, and use cases
- Include proper error handling with Either types
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Follow Flutter naming conventions
- Write testable code

Directory structure:
- lib/features/[feature_name]/
  - domain/ (entities, repositories, use cases)
  - data/ (models, repositories, data sources)
  - presentation/ (blocs, pages, widgets)

Example:
When asked to create a login feature, generate:
1. Domain entities and repository interfaces
2. Data models and repository implementations
3. Use cases (LoginUseCase)
4. BLoC for presentation logic
5. UI pages and widgets
```

**API Integration Agent:**

```markdown
You are an API integration specialist.

Guidelines:
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use try-catch blocks for network calls
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Log all API calls for debugging
- Use environment variables for API URLs
- Parse responses into typed models
- Add timeout configurations
- Include loading states

Response structure:
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": any,
  "error": string | null
}

Always validate responses before using data.
```

**Code Review Agent:**

```markdown
You are a code reviewer focusing on:

1. Security: Check for vulnerabilities and exposed secrets
2. Performance: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
3. Best Practices: Ensure code follows language conventions
4. Maintainability: Look for code smells and suggest refactoring
5. Testing: Verify adequate test coverage

When reviewing:
- Explain WHY something is an issue
- Suggest specific improvements
- Provide code examples
- Prioritize issues (critical, important, minor)
- Be constructive and helpful
```

## Using Agents in Your Workspace

### Automatic Agent Loading

When you create a new sandbox, Teta automatically:

1. Fetches your personal or team agents
2. Creates YAML configuration files in the file system
3. Makes agents available to the AI

### Agent File Structure

Agents are stored as YAML files:

```yaml
---
name: flutter-best-practices
description: Enforces Flutter coding standards and best practices
---

[Your agent prompt here]
```

## Agent Best Practices

### 1. Keep Agents Focused

Each agent should have a single, clear purpose:

- ✅ "Database Migration Generator"
- ❌ "Do Everything Agent"

### 2. Use Multiple Agents

Create specialized agents for different tasks:

- **Architecture Agent**: Enforces project structure
- **Testing Agent**: Generates tests
- **Documentation Agent**: Creates comprehensive docs
- **Refactoring Agent**: Improves existing code

### 3. Iterate and Improve

Monitor how your agents perform:

- Review generated code quality
- Update prompts based on results
- Add more specific instructions over time
- Remove unnecessary constraints

### 4. Share Knowledge

For teams:

- Document agent purposes
- Share successful prompts
- Create a library of proven agents
- Establish team standards through agents

## Common Agent Use Cases

### 1. Code Style Enforcement

```markdown
Always follow these style rules:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas
- Sort imports alphabetically
```

### 2. Framework-Specific Guidelines

```markdown
For Flutter components:
- Use StatelessWidget unless state is required
- Follow Material Design guidelines
- Use const constructors where possible
- Avoid using setState; prefer state management solutions
```

### 3. Documentation Generation

```markdown
For every function, generate comments:
- Description of purposes
- Parameter explanations
- Return values
- Example usage
```

### 4. Testing Standards

```markdown
For each feature, create:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Widget tests for UI (Flutter)
- Integration tests for workflows
- Mock external dependencies
- Achieve 80%+ code coverage
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

Agents can include conditional behavior:

```markdown
If the user asks to modify an existing file:
- Read the file first
- Understand the current structure
- Make minimal changes
- Preserve existing functionality

If creating a new feature:
- Generate all required files
- Include tests
- Update documentation
- Add to index exports
```

### Context Awareness

Agents can reference project state:

```markdown
Before making changes:
1. Check if the file exists
2. Review related files
3. Understand dependencies
4. Consider impact on existing code

If working with state management:
- Check current state solution (BLoC, Provider, Riverpod)
- Follow existing patterns
- Don't mix state management approaches
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Working

**Symptoms**: Agent instructions aren't being followed

**Solutions**:
1. Check agent YAML file in `.claude/agents/`
2. Verify prompt is clear and specific
3. Ensure agent name is properly formatted
4. Try restarting the sandbox

### Conflicting Agents

**Symptoms**: AI gives inconsistent responses

**Solutions**:
1. Review all active agents
2. Check for contradictory instructions
3. Consolidate similar agents
4. Use more specific agent names

### Agent Files Not Loading

**Symptoms**: Changes to agents don't appear

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Teta has your agents
2. Check sandbox logs for errors
3. Restart the development machine

## Example: Complete Agent Setup

Here's a real-world example for a Flutter e-commerce project:

### 1. Project Standards Agent

```yaml
---
name: e-commerce-standards
description: Enforces coding standards for our e-commerce platform
---

Project: Flutter E-commerce App

Technology Stack:
- Flutter 3.x
- BLoC for state management
- Supabase for backend
- GoRouter for navigation
- Hive for local storage

File Structure:
lib/
  core/ (constants, themes, utils)
  features/ (feature-based modules)
  shared/ (shared widgets, models)

Coding Rules:
1. Use meaningful variable names
2. Extract magic numbers to constants
3. Create reusable widgets
4. Handle loading/error states
5. Add analytics tracking
6. Implement offline support
```

### 2. API Agent

```yaml
---
name: supabase-api-handler
description: Generates Supabase API integration code
---

For all Supabase operations:

1. Repository Pattern:
   - Create interface in domain layer
   - Implement in data layer
   - Use dependency injection

2. Error Handling:
   - Wrap in try-catch
   - Return Either<Failure, Success>
   - Log errors with context

3. Data Transformation:
   - Parse JSON to models
   - Validate data
   - Handle null values

Example structure:
abstract class ProductRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Product>>> getProducts();
}

class ProductRepositoryImpl implements ProductRepository {
  final SupabaseClient client;

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Product>>> getProducts() async {
    try {
      final response = await client.from('products').select();
      final products = (response as List)
          .map((json) => Product.fromJson(json))
          .toList();
      return Right(products);
    } catch (e) {
      return Left(ServerFailure(e.toString()));
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. UI Agent

```yaml
---
name: consistent-ui-components
description: Creates UI components following design system
---

Design System:
- Primary Color: #1E88E5
- Font: Inter
- Spacing: 8px base unit
- Border Radius: 12px for cards, 8px for buttons

For all widgets:
1. Use theme colors, never hardcode
2. Implement responsive layouts
3. Add loading states
4. Include error states
5. Support dark mode
6. Add accessibility labels

Button styles:
- Primary: Filled with primary color
- Secondary: Outlined
- Text: Text-only for tertiary actions

Always extract reusable widgets to shared/widgets/
```

## Conclusion

AI Agents are powerful tools for standardizing your development workflow and ensuring consistent, high-quality code generation. Start with a few focused agents and expand as you identify patterns in your work.
