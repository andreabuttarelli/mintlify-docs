## Overview

At Teta, we strive to provide the best AI-powered development experience. We understand that sometimes a service may not meet your expectations, which is why we offer a fair and transparent refund policy.

## Refund Eligibility

Refunds are available under the following conditions:

### Eligible for Refund

You may request a refund if:

1. **Technical Issues**: You experienced significant technical problems that prevented you from using the platform as intended
2. **Service Disruption**: Major service outages or interruptions that affected your work
3. **Billing Errors**: You were charged incorrectly or multiple times
4. **Feature Discrepancies**: Advertised features were unavailable or non-functional

### Usage Limitations

Due to the high computational costs of AI services, refunds are only available if:

- **Less than 5% of your plan's tokens have been used**, OR
- **Less than 500,000 tokens have been consumed** (whichever is lower)

**Example**:
- Pro plan (6M tokens): Refund available if used < 300,000 tokens (5%)
- Pro+ plan (12M tokens): Refund available if used < 500,000 tokens (capped)
- Max plan (50M tokens): Refund available if used < 500,000 tokens (capped)

## Non-Refundable Situations

Refunds will **not** be issued in the following cases:

❌ Change of mind after extensive usage
❌ Usage exceeding the 5% or 500k token threshold
❌ Violation of our Terms of Service or Fair Usage Policy
❌ Account suspension due to abuse or misuse
❌ Requests made more than 14 days after the initial charge

## Why This Policy?

AI services incur substantial costs:

- **Computational Resources**: Each AI interaction requires expensive GPU/TPU processing
- **Model Access**: Access to premium models (Claude, Gemini, etc.) has direct costs
- **Infrastructure**: Real-time preview environments, cloud resources, and data processing
- **Operational Costs**: These expenses are incurred immediately upon usage

Once tokens are consumed, the associated costs cannot be recovered. Our policy ensures fairness while protecting the sustainability of the service.

## How to Request a Refund

If you believe you qualify for a refund, follow these steps:

### 1. Check Your Usage

1. Go to **Settings** > **Pricing/Subscription**
