## What is Base Path?

The **Base Path** setting allows you to specify a subdirectory within your repository where your application code resides. This is particularly useful for monorepos or projects where the main application is not located at the repository root.

## How It Works

### What Base Path Affects

The Base Path setting influences:

✅ **Flutter app execution** - Where to run `flutter run` or `flutter build`
✅ **Svelte app execution** - Where to run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`
✅ **React app execution** - Where to run development and build commands
✅ **Web deployment** - Where to deploy from when publishing your app
✅ **Build processes** - Which directory to use for build operations

### What Base Path Does NOT Affect

❌ **Repository cloning** - The entire repository is always cloned
❌ **Git operations** - Git commands work on the full repository
❌ **Sandbox environment** - The complete project branch is available in the sandbox
❌ **File access** - You can still access files outside the base path

## Configuration

### Setting Your Base Path

1. Open your project in Teta
2. Go to **App Settings** > **App Info**
3. Find the **Base Path** field
4. Enter your desired path

### Path Format Rules

**Important**: Follow these formatting rules:

✅ **Correct format**:
```
apps/frontend
packages/mobile
client
```

❌ **Incorrect format**:
```
/apps/frontend  ❌ Do not start with /
apps/frontend/  ❌ Do not end with /
./apps/frontend ❌ Do not use ./
```

### Empty Base Path

If you leave the Base Path field **empty**:
- It defaults to the **root of your repository**
- Commands will execute from the repository root
- Deployment will use the root directory

## Use Cases

### Monorepo Structure

If your repository has multiple applications:

```
my-repo/
├── apps/
│   ├── mobile/        ← Flutter app
│   ├── web/           ← React app
│   └── admin/         ← Svelte app
├── packages/
│   └── shared/
└── README.md
```

**Base Path examples**:
- For mobile app: `apps/mobile`
- For web app: `apps/web`
- For admin app: `apps/admin`

### Nested Project

If your main app is in a subdirectory:

```
my-repo/
├── docs/
├── scripts/
├── frontend/          ← Your main app is here
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── pubspec.yaml
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

**Base Path**: `frontend`

### Root Level Project

If your app is at the repository root:

```
my-repo/
├── lib/
├── pubspec.yaml      ← App files at root
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

**Base Path**: Leave empty (or you can explicitly set it to `.`)

## Examples by Framework

### Flutter Projects

**Typical structure**:
```
my-repo/
└── flutter_app/
    ├── lib/
    ├── android/
    ├── ios/
    └── pubspec.yaml
```

**Base Path**: `flutter_app`

**Effect**:
- `flutter run` executes in `flutter_app/`
- `flutter build` runs in `flutter_app/`
- Deployment uses `flutter_app/build/web`

### React Projects

**Typical structure**:
```
my-repo/
└── react-app/
    ├── src/
    ├── public/
    └── package.json
```

**Base Path**: `react-app`

**Effect**:
- `npm install` runs in `react-app/`
- `npm run dev` executes in `react-app/`
- Deployment uses `react-app/build` or `react-app/dist`

### Svelte Projects

**Typical structure**:
```
my-repo/
└── svelte-app/
    ├── src/
    ├── static/
    └── package.json
```

**Base Path**: `svelte-app`

**Effect**:
- `npm install` runs in `svelte-app/`
- `npm run dev` executes in `svelte-app/`
- Deployment uses `svelte-app/build`

## How Teta Uses Base Path

### During Development

When you start your app preview:
1. Teta clones the **entire repository**
2. Teta navigates to the **Base Path directory**
3. Teta executes framework-specific commands (e.g., `flutter run`, `npm run dev`)
4. Your app runs from the specified directory

### During Deployment

When you publish your app:
1. Teta builds your app in the **Base Path directory**
2. Teta collects build artifacts from the **Base Path** (e.g., `build/web`, `dist/`)
3. Teta deploys only the built files

### AI Assistance

When working with AI:
- AI can access **all files** in your repository
- AI understands your Base Path configuration
- AI executes commands relative to the Base Path when appropriate
- You can still ask AI to modify files outside the Base Path

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

**Problem**: Preview shows errors or won't start

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your Base Path is correct
2. Check that `pubspec.yaml` or `package.json` exists in the Base Path
3. Ensure the path format is correct (no leading/trailing slashes)
4. Try leaving Base Path empty if your app is at the root

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Deployment or build commands fail

**Solutions**:
1. Confirm the Base Path contains the correct build configuration
2. Check that all dependencies are properly defined in the Base Path
3. Verify build output directories exist (e.g., `build/`, `dist/`)
4. Review build logs for path-related errors

### Wrong Directory

**Problem**: Commands are running in the wrong location

**Solutions**:
1. Double-check the Base Path setting in **Settings** > **Project Settings**
2. Ensure the path matches your repository structure exactly
3. Remember: paths are case-sensitive
4. Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep It Simple

Use Base Path only when necessary:
- ✅ Use for monorepos with multiple apps
- ✅ Use for nested project structures
- ❌ Don't use if your app is at the root
- ❌ Avoid overly deep nesting

### 2. Document Your Structure

Add a note in your repository's README:
```markdown
## Project Structure

This is a monorepo. The main Flutter app is located in `apps/mobile/`.

Teta Base Path: `apps/mobile`
```

### 3. Consistent Naming

Use clear, descriptive directory names:
- ✅ `apps/mobile`, `apps/web`, `packages/ui`
- ❌ `app1`, `proj`, `x`

### 4. Test After Changing

After updating Base Path:
1. Save the setting
2. Restart your preview
3. Verify the app runs correctly
4. Test deployment if applicable

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Environments

For projects with multiple environments:

```
my-repo/
├── apps/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── production/
```

**Strategy**:
- Use different Teta projects for each environment
- Set different Base Paths for each project
- Link to different branches if needed

### Shared Dependencies

For monorepos with shared code:

```
my-repo/
├── apps/
│   └── mobile/        ← Base Path here
├── packages/
│   └── shared/        ← Shared code here
```

**Note**:
- Base Path set to `apps/mobile`
- AI can still access and modify `packages/shared/`
- Build tools can reference parent directories

## Related Settings

Base Path works alongside other project settings:

- **Branch**: Which branch to clone (entire repo is still cloned)
- **GitHub Integration**: Repository connection (unaffected by Base Path)
- **Environment Variables**: Defined for the Base Path context
- **Build Commands**: Execute relative to the Base Path

## FAQs

### Can I use absolute paths?

No, Base Path must be relative to the repository root.

### Can I change Base Path after deployment?

Yes, but you'll need to redeploy your app for changes to take effect.

### Does Base Path affect Git operations?

No, Git operations (commit, push, pull) always work on the full repository.

### Can I have multiple Base Paths?

Not in a single Teta project. Create separate projects for different apps in your monorepo.

### What if my Base Path doesn't exist?

Teta will show an error. Ensure the path exists in your repository before setting it.

### Does Base Path affect file uploads?

No, file uploads and AI file operations can access the entire repository.
