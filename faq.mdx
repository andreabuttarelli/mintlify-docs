## Teta App

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's Teta">
    Teta is an AI-powered app builder that turns a plain-language prompt into a full Flutter codebase—UI, business logic, tests, and build pipeline included. You can iterate visually in the browser, then export or deploy the very same production-grade code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Who is Teta for?">
    | **Profile**               | **Why they use Teta**                                                              |
    | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Founders & start-ups      | Ship an MVP in days, validate early, stay in control of the source.                |
    | Designers / Product teams | Prototype native apps without waiting for dev capacity.                            |
    | Flutter developers        | Automate boilerplate, focus on advanced logic, keep clean architecture.            |
    | Agencies & SI             | Parallel-run multiple client projects, cut delivery time, white-label deployments. |
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does the build flow work?">
    1. Describe – Write a prompt or paste wireframes / user stories.
    2. Decompose – Teta’s agent splits the spec into tasks (screens, state, data, tests).
    3. Generate – AI engineer agent creates code following best practises.
    4. Inspect & tweak – Live preview, visual editors, or ask the Teta agent to refactor code.
    5. Ship – One-click web deploy or push changes to GitHub
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What platforms does the generated code target?">
    - Websites (SvelteKit)
    - Web Apps (SvelteKit or Flutter)
    - Android & iOS (Flutter)
    - macOS, Windows, and Linux (Flutter)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I really edit the code?">
    Absolutely. Every project is a real repo. You can:

    - Export locally or push to GitHub (see more).
    - Keep two-way sync—changes in the IDE can be pushed; merged changes flow back into Teta.
    - Add or swap any [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pub.dev](http://pub.dev) package, write platform channels, or integrate existing modules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is the generated code production quality?">
    Yes. Teta AI engineer agent uses lint, enforce layered separation, and auto-generate unit \+ widget tests. You can high coverage with one command, then integrate into any CI/CD system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does deployment work?">
    | **Target**          | **How**                                                   |

    | Cloud-native AI engineer agent â€“ Teta behaves like a senior dev that never sleeps: it reads and rewrites files, runs Bash commands, lints, executes tests, even triggers full builds to catch runtime errors before you do. | You're not getting a static code generator. You're getting an autonomous teammate that iterates until the build is green. |
    | Dual-stack output (Flutter and SvelteKit)                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pick the front-end technology that fits your product or team skills; switch later without rewriting from scratch.         |
    | Supabase & GitHub native, not bolted on â€“ two-way schema sync, RLS awareness, branch PRs, and CI status checks are first-class citizens.                                                                                    | Data model and source control stay where developers expect themâ€”no babysitting exports or manual merges.                |
    | Real, ownership-free code â€“ full Flutter/SvelteKit repos under MIT license; no proprietary JSON or binary blobs.                                                                                                            | Total portability, legal clarity, zero vendor lock-in.                                                                    |
    | Developer-first ergonomics â€“ hot-reload, keyboard shortcuts, CLI & headless API, VS Code extension.                                                                                                                         | Builders target citizen devs; Teta supercharges actual devs and technical founders.                                       |
    | Multi-agent reasoning â€“ specialized sub-agents write tests, craft API stubs, generate copy, and suggest performance fixes.                                                                                                  | Your project arrives with test coverage, documentation, and UX polish baked in.                                           |
    | Workflow transparency â€“ every AI action is logged as a pull request or terminal output you can audit.                                                                                                                       | Compliance & audit trails out-of-the-box, essential for enterprise and regulated sectors.                                 |
