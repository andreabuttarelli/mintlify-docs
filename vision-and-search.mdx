description: "How Teta's AI can analyze images, videos, and web pages directly from URLs"
---

## What Can the AI See?

The AI can analyze:
- **Images** (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
- **Videos** (through URL links)
- **Web pages** (content and structure)
- **Screenshots**
- **Diagrams and mockups**

## How It Works

There are **no dedicated buttons** or special commands. Simply paste a URL in your message and the AI will automatically:
1. Fetch the content
2. Analyze it (vision for images/videos, text extraction for web pages)
3. Use that context to answer your question

### For Images and Videos

**Just paste the URL** in your message:

```
You: Take a look at this design mockup: https://example.com/mockup.png
     Can you recreate this UI in Flutter?
```

The AI will:
- Analyze the image
- Understand the layout, colors, and components
- Generate the corresponding Flutter code

**Supported formats**:
- Image URLs: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`
- Video URLs: Direct video links

### For Web Pages

**Just paste the URL** of the website:

```
You: Read this documentation: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth
     and help me implement authentication in my app
```

The AI will:
- Fetch the web page content
- Extract relevant information
- Use it to provide accurate, up-to-date answers

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Design Implementation

**You:**
```
Here's our new login screen design: https://figma.com/file/xyz
Implement this in Flutter with proper animations
```

The AI will analyze the design and create matching code.

### 2. Bug Reports with Screenshots

**You:**
```
I'm getting this error: https://i.imgur.com/error123.png
What's wrong?
```

The AI will read the error message and help debug.

### 3. Documentation Research

**You:**
```
Check out https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart
and refactor my code following these best practices
```

The AI will read the documentation and apply the guidelines.

### 4. Code from Diagrams

**You:**
```
Convert this database schema to Supabase tables: https://example.com/schema.png
```

The AI will analyze the diagram and generate SQL or Supabase schema.

### 5. Real-time Information

**You:**
```
Search for the latest Flutter 3.28 breaking changes and update my code
```

The AI will search the web and find current information.

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific About What You Want

Good:
```
Look at this UI: https://example.com/ui.png
Recreate the navigation bar component with the exact colors and spacing
```

Vague:
```
Make something like this: https://example.com/ui.png
```

### 2. Combine Multiple Sources

```
Compare these two implementations:
- https://example.com/approach-a.png
- https://example.com/approach-b.png

Which is better for my use case?
```

### 3. Reference Documentation

```
Following the guidelines from https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets
create a custom widget for my product card
```

### 4. Use Recent Sources

For web search, mention "latest" or "current" to get up-to-date results:

```
What are the latest Supabase Edge Functions best practices in 2025?
```

## What the AI Can Analyze

### From Images

- **UI/UX Design**: Layouts, colors, typography, spacing
- **Diagrams**: Architecture, flows, schemas
- **Code Screenshots**: Error messages, stack traces, code snippets
- **Charts/Graphs**: Data visualization patterns
- **Mockups**: Design specifications

### From Videos

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Demos**: Feature implementations
- **Presentations**: Technical concepts
- **Screen Recordings**: Bug reproductions

### From Web Pages

- **Documentation**: API references, guides, tutorials
- **Articles**: Best practices, comparisons, solutions
- **Stack Overflow**: Error solutions, code examples
- **GitHub**: README files, code examples, issues
- **Blog Posts**: Technical tutorials, announcements

## Privacy & Security

### What Gets Shared

When you include a URL:
- The AI fetches public content from that URL
- For images/videos: Visual analysis is performed
- For web pages: Text content is extracted and analyzed

### What Stays Private

- The AI only accesses **public** URLs you explicitly provide
- Your local files are never uploaded (unless you explicitly share them)
- No automatic web searches happen without your request

### Best Practices

Do:
- Share public documentation and resources
- Use image hosting services for screenshots
- Reference public GitHub repositories

Don't:
- Share URLs containing sensitive information
- Include authentication tokens in URLs
- Link to private company resources (unless intentional)

## Limitations

### Images & Videos

- Images & Videos consumes a large amount of tokens
- Videos are analyzed via URL context, not frame-by-frame
- Animated content may be analyzed as static frames

### Web Search

- Results reflect current web content (not real-time data feeds)
- Some paywalled or authentication-required sites may not be accessible
- Search quality depends on query specificity
- Web search can increase the token usage, depending on the amount of content fetched

### General

- The AI can't interact with dynamic web content (buttons, forms)
- Can't access content behind authentication (unless you have MCP servers configured)
- Some websites may block automated access

## Advanced: Combining Vision with MCP Servers

For enhanced capabilities, you can combine vision/web search with MCP servers:

**Example with Supabase MCP:**

```
You: Look at this database design: https://example.com/schema.png

     Then query my Supabase database and tell me what changes
     I need to make to match this design
```

The AI will:
1. Analyze the schema image (Vision)
2. Query your actual database (Supabase MCP)
3. Compare and generate migration scripts

**Example with GitHub MCP:**

```
You: Check the latest commit in the repository
     and compare it with this screenshot of the error: https://i.imgur.com/bug.png
```

The AI will:
1. Read the error from the image (Vision)
2. Fetch recent commits (GitHub MCP)
3. Identify the likely cause

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Loading

**Problem**: "I can't access that image"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the URL is publicly accessible
2. Check the image format is supported
3. Ensure the link is direct (ends in `.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)
4. Try re-uploading to a different host (Imgur, GitHub, etc.)

### Web Page Not Accessible

**Problem**: "I can't fetch that page"

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the page requires authentication
2. Verify the URL is correct and accessible
3. Some sites block automated access—try sharing the relevant text instead
4. Check if the page is behind a paywall

### Search Results Not Relevant

**Problem**: Web search returns poor results

**Solutions**:
1. Be more specific in your query
2. Include technical terms and version numbers
3. Mention the year if you need recent information
4. Try multiple search attempts with refined queries

## Examples

### Example 1: Recreate UI from Screenshot

**You:**
```
https://dribbble.com/shots/example-ui
Create this login screen in Flutter
```

**AI Response:**
```dart
// Analyzes the image and generates:
class LoginScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      backgroundColor: Color(0xFF1A1A2E), // Extracted from image
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Logo matching the design...
            // Input fields with matching styling...
            // Button with exact colors and shadows...
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Debug with Error Screenshot

**You:**
```
I'm getting this error: https://i.imgur.com/flutter-error.png
What's the issue?
```

**AI Response:**
```
The error shows a "Null check operator used on a null value" in your
UserProfile widget at line 45. This happens because:

1. The 'user' object is null when the widget builds
2. You're using '!' operator which assumes non-null

Fix by adding null safety:

```

### Example 3: Learn from Documentation

**You:**
```
Read https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime
and add real-time subscriptions to my chat app
```

**AI Response:**
```
Based on the Supabase Realtime documentation, here's how to implement
real-time chat:

[Provides implementation using correct Supabase Realtime API]
```

### Example 4: Compare Approaches

**You:**
```
Compare these two state management approaches:
- https://riverpod.dev/docs/concepts/providers
- https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple

Which should I use for my e-commerce app?
```

**AI Response:**
```
After reviewing both approaches:

Riverpod (Provider 2.0):
- Better for complex apps with many dependencies
- Excellent testing support
- Compile-time safety
- More boilerplate

Provider (Simple):
- Good for small to medium apps
- Easier learning curve
- Less boilerplate
- Flutter team's recommendation for beginners

For your e-commerce app, I recommend Riverpod because:
