## How Credit System Works

Teta's credit system is designed to provide fair pricing based on:
1. **Token consumption** (input + output + cache)
2. **Extended workflows** (iterations and multiple AI responses)

### Token-Based Credits

```
1 credit = 40,000 tokens processed
```

**How it works:**
- For each AI call, we sum: `input_tokens + output_tokens + cache_read_tokens`
- Credits = `total_tokens ÷ 40000` (integer division)
- One credit is charged each time you reach 40k cumulative tokens

**Example:**
- Call 1: 15,000 tokens → 0 credits
- Call 2: 20,000 tokens → 1 credits (total: 35,000 tokens)
- Call 3: 8,000 tokens → 0 credit (total: 43,000 tokens)
- Call 4: 25,000 tokens → 1 credits (total: 68,000 tokens)
- Call 5: 15,000 tokens → 1 credit (total: 83,000 tokens)

### Extended Workflow Credits

#### Iteration Credits
```
Every 5 iterations = +1 credit
```

- Iterations 1-4: Free (part of base workflow)
- Iterations 5, 10, 15, 20...: +1 credit each

## Usage Examples

### Simple Request
```
User: "Fix this bug in my code"
- 1 user message + 1 AI response
- 8,000 total tokens
- Credits: 1 (under 30k tokens, no extended workflow, + 1 user message)
```

### Medium Workflow
```
User: "Create a new feature with tests"
- 1 user message + 8 AI responses
- 35,000 total tokens
- Credits: 3 (1 for tokens + 1 for response #5 + 1 user message)
```

### Complex Workflow
```
User: "Refactor the entire codebase"
- 1 user message + 25 AI responses
- 20 iterations
- 180,000 total tokens

Credits breakdown:
- User message: 1 credit
- Tokens: 5 credits (180k ÷ 30k = 5 → 5)
- Iterations: 4 credits (iter 5, 10, 15, 20)
- TOTAL: 10 credits
```

### Cache-Heavy Workflow
```
User: "Analyze and optimize the entire project"
- 1 user message + 15 AI responses
- 10 iterations
- Token breakdown:
  * Input: 80,000 tokens
  * Output: 60,000 tokens
  * Cache read: 45,000 tokens
  * TOTAL: 185,000 tokens

Credits breakdown:
- User message: 1 credit
- Tokens: 5 credits (185k ÷ 30k = 5 → 5)
- Iterations: 2 credits (iter 5, 10)
- TOTAL: 8 credits
```

  <Accordion title="What are credits in Teta?">
    Credits are used for AI agent actions like generating code or making edits. Each credit is calculated based on token consumption (1 credit = 40,000 tokens) and extended workflow usage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do long or short prompts cost the same?">
    No, costs are based on actual token consumption. Simple requests under 40,000 tokens may not consume any token-based credits, while complex workflows will use more credits based on total tokens processed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I get more credits?">
    You can upgrade your plan in your Account Settings to access more credits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When does my credit count reset?">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do I see different credit consumption for similar requests?">
    Credit consumption depends on multiple factors: token usage (input + output + cache), number of AI responses, and workflow iterations. Extended workflows with many back-and-forth interactions will consume more credits than simple requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the refund policy?">
    We only issue refunds under the following conditions:

    1. **No credits were used** during your billing cycle.
    2. **Credits were consumed**, but usage consistently resulted in errors **not caused by your prompts**.
