## What is Slack Integration?

The Slack integration allows the AI in Teta to connect to your Slack workspace. This enables a variety of automated tasks, such as:

- 📢 Sending notifications about build statuses
- 💬 Posting messages to channels or users
- 📈 Reporting metrics or logs
- 🤖 Creating simple interactive bots

This helps keep your team updated and integrates Teta into your existing communication workflows.

## Built-in Slack MCP Server

Teta provides a built-in MCP server for Slack that makes it easy to get started.

**Capabilities**:
- Send messages to public and private channels
- Send direct messages to users
- Upload files and snippets
- Use Block Kit for rich message formatting

**Setup**: To enable the Slack MCP server, you'll need to provide a Slack Bot Token.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **"Create New App"**.
2. Choose **"From scratch"**.
3. Give your app a name (e.g., "Teta Notifier") and select your workspace.
4. Click **"Create App"**.

### Step 2: Configure Permissions

1. In your app's settings, go to **"OAuth & Permissions"**.
2. Scroll down to the **"Scopes"** section.
3. Under **"Bot Token Scopes"**, add the following scopes:
   - `chat:write`: To send messages
   - `files:write`: To upload files
   - `users:read.email`: To find users by email (optional)

### Step 3: Install the App and Get Token

1. At the top of the **"OAuth & Permissions"** page, click **"Install to Workspace"**.
2. Authorize the app.
3. After installation, you'll see a **"Bot User OAuth Token"**. Copy this token. It will start with `xoxb-`.

### Step 4: Add Token to Teta

1. In your Teta project, go to **Settings** > **MCPs**.
2. Click **"Add MCP"**.
3. Add a name for the secret, for example `server-slack`.
4. Add the following JSON configuration, replacing `<YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN>` with the token you copied.

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"],
  "env": {
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "$SLACK_TOKEN"
  }
}
```
5. In the Secrets section, add a new secret named `SLACK_TOKEN` and paste your Bot User OAuth Token.

## Configuration Example

**Secret Name**: `server-slack`

**Secret Value**:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"],
  "env": {
    "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "<YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once the Slack MCP server is configured, you can instruct the AI to send messages.

### Send a Simple Message

```
You: "Send a message to the #general channel saying 'Hello, world!'"
```

### Notify on Build Completion

```
You: "After the build is complete, send a message to #devops saying 'Build successful!'"
```

### Send a Direct Message

```
You: "Send a DM to user@example.com with the message 'Your report is ready.'"
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Dedicated Tokens

- Create a dedicated Slack App for Teta.
- Don't reuse tokens from other applications.

### 2. Limit Scopes

- Only grant the permissions that are absolutely necessary. For sending messages, `chat:write` is usually sufficient.
- Avoid granting broad permissions like `admin` or `chat:write.public`.

### 3. Protect Your Token

- Treat your Slack Bot Token as a secret.
- Never commit it directly to your repository.
- Use Teta's secret management to store it securely.

## Conclusion

The Slack integration provides a simple yet powerful way to connect Teta to your team's communication hub, enabling automated notifications and a more interactive development experience.
