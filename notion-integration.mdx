## What is Notion Integration?

The Notion integration allows the AI in Teta to connect to your Notion workspace. This enables you to:

- 📖 **Read Notion pages** and databases for context.
- 🧠 **Answer questions** based on your internal documentation.
- 💡 **Generate ideas** and content based on your existing knowledge base.
- ✍️ **Create new pages** or add content to existing ones (coming soon).

This turns your Notion workspace into a powerful source of truth for the AI, ensuring that its outputs are aligned with your team's knowledge.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Notion Integration

1.  Go to the [Notion My Integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and click **"New integration"**.
2.  Give your integration a name (e.g., "Teta AI").
3.  Select the workspace where you want to install the integration.
4.  For capabilities, select **"Read content"**. Write capabilities are not yet supported.
5.  Click **"Submit"**.

### Step 2: Get the Integration Token

1.  On the next screen, you'll see your **"Internal Integration Token"**. Copy this token.

### Step 3: Share Your Pages/Databases with the Integration

1.  Go to the Notion page or database you want to share with Teta.
2.  Click the **"•••"** menu in the top-right corner.
3.  Click **"Add connections"** (or **"Connections"** > **"Connect to"**).
4.  Find and select your new integration (e.g., "Teta AI").
5.  Confirm that you want to grant access.

### Step 4: Add Token to Teta

1.  In your Teta project, go to **Settings** > **MCPs**.
2.  Click **"Add MCP"**.
3.  Add a name for the secret, for example `server-notion`.
4.  Add the following JSON configuration, replacing `<YOUR_NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN>` with the token you copied.

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion"],
  "env": {
    "NOTION_API_KEY": "$NOTION_TOKEN"
  }
}
```
5. In the Secrets section, add a new secret named `NOTION_TOKEN` and paste your Internal Integration Token.

## Configuration Example

**Secret Name**: `server-notion`

**Secret Value**:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-notion"],
  "env": {
    "NOTION_API_KEY": "<YOUR_NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN>"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once the Notion MCP server is configured, you can instruct the AI to use Notion as a source of information.

### Summarize a Document

```
You: "Summarize the 'Project Phoenix' planning document in Notion."
```

### Answer a Question Based on a Knowledge Base

```
You: "According to our engineering principles in Notion, what is our policy on code reviews?"
```

### Generate Code Based on a Spec

```
You: "Read the product spec for the new login page in Notion and generate the initial React component."
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Limit Access

- Only share the specific Notion pages and databases that Teta needs to access.
- Avoid sharing your entire workspace if possible.

### 2. Use Read-Only Tokens

- The current Notion MCP server only supports read access, which is a good security practice.
- When write support is added, use separate tokens for read-only and write operations if possible.

### 3. Protect Your Token

- Treat your Notion Integration Token as a secret.
- Never commit it directly to your repository.
- Use Teta's secret management to store it securely.

## Conclusion

The Notion integration is a powerful way to provide the Teta AI with deep, project-specific context, leading to more accurate and helpful responses.
