## What is Linear Integration?

The Linear integration allows the AI in Teta to connect to your Linear workspace. This enables you to:

- 📖 **Read issue descriptions** and comments for context.
- 💡 **Generate code or prototypes** directly from Linear issues.
- 🔄 **Update issue statuses** and add comments.
- ✍️ **Create new issues** from Teta.

This integration streamlines your development workflow, allowing you to move seamlessly from issue tracking to implementation.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Linear Webhook

1.  In Linear, go to **Settings** > **API**.
2.  Click **"New Webhook"**.
3.  Give it a **Label** (e.g., "Teta Integration").
4.  For the **URL**, you will need to provide the URL of your Teta MCP server. This will be provided to you when you set up the MCP server.
5.  Select the events you want to subscribe to, such as `IssueCreate`, `IssueUpdate`, etc.
6.  Click **"Create webhook"**.

### Step 2: Get a Personal API Key

1.  In Linear, go to **Settings** > **API**.
2.  Under **"Personal API keys"**, click **"Create key"**.
3.  Give it a **Label** (e.g., "Teta AI Key").
4.  Copy the generated API key.

### Step 3: Add Key to Teta

1.  In your Teta project, go to **Settings** > **MCPs**.
2.  Click **"Add MCP"**.
3.  Add a name for the secret, for example `server-linear`.
4.  Add the following JSON configuration, replacing `<YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY>` with the key you copied.

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
  "env": {
    "LINEAR_API_KEY": "$LINEAR_TOKEN"
  }
}
```
5. In the Secrets section, add a new secret named `LINEAR_TOKEN` and paste your Personal API Key.

## Configuration Example

**Secret Name**: `server-linear`

**Secret Value**:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
  "env": {
    "LINEAR_API_KEY": "<YOUR_LINEAR_API_KEY>"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once the Linear MCP server is configured, you can interact with Linear issues.

### Generate a Prototype from an Issue

```
You: "Read issue ENG-123 in Linear and create a prototype for the new login page."
```

### Update an Issue

```
You: "Mark issue ENG-123 as 'In Progress' and add a comment saying 'Started working on the prototype.'"
```

### Create a New Issue

```
You: "Create a new issue in the 'Engineering' team with the title 'Fix button alignment on homepage' and a description 'The primary call-to-action button is misaligned on mobile devices.'"
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Specific Keys

- Create a dedicated Personal API Key for Teta.
- Avoid using your personal account's key if possible; use a bot or service account if your plan allows.

### 2. Limit Scope (if possible)

- While Linear's Personal API Keys have broad access, be mindful of what you automate.
- Avoid creating automation that could perform destructive actions without review.

### 3. Protect Your Key

- Treat your Linear API Key as a secret.
- Never commit it directly to your repository.
- Use Teta's secret management to store it securely.

## Conclusion

The Linear integration bridges the gap between project management and development, allowing you to turn plans into action more efficiently.
