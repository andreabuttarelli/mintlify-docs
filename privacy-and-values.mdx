## Our Commitment

At Teta, we believe in **privacy by design** and **ethical AI development**. Your code is yours, your data is protected, and our platform is built on principles of respect, inclusivity, and security.

## Privacy & Security

### Zero Code Storage

**Your source code never touches our servers.**

- ✅ Code is **only cloned in temporary, isolated VMs**
- ✅ VMs are **destroyed immediately** after your session ends
- ✅ **No code persistence** - we don't save, cache, or store your codebase
- ✅ **No backups** of your code on Teta servers

**What this means for you**:
- Your proprietary code remains private
- No risk of data breaches exposing your codebase
- Complete control over your intellectual property

### Ephemeral Sandboxes

Every development session runs in a **disposable, isolated environment**:

```
Session Start → Clone repo to VM → You work → Session ends → VM destroyed
                                                            ↓
                                                    All code deleted
```

**Sandbox characteristics**:
- **Isolated**: Each sandbox is completely separate from others
- **Temporary**: Automatically destroyed when you close your project
- **Secure**: No cross-contamination between projects or users

### GitHub Integration Security

- ✅ **No passwords stored** - authentication handled by GitHub
- ✅ **Scoped permissions** - access only to repositories you authorize
- ✅ **Revocable anytime** - you control access via GitHub settings

You have **complete control** over which repositories Teta can access.

### What We Store

We only save **non-sensitive metadata** necessary for the service:

**We DO store**:
- ✅ Project name and settings (branch name, base path, etc.)
- ✅ Usage statistics (token consumption, request counts)
- ✅ User preferences (UI settings, agent configurations)
- ✅ MCP server configurations (endpoints, settings)
- ✅ GitHub repository references (repo name, URL)

**We DO NOT store**:
- ❌ Your source code
- ❌ File contents from your repository
- ❌ Git commit contents
- ❌ Build artifacts

### AI Provider Interactions

When you use Teta's AI features:

**What gets sent to AI providers** (Claude, Gemini, etc.):
- Code snippets you're working on (for context)
- Your prompts and questions
- File contents relevant to your request

**Important notes**:
- Only **relevant code** is sent, not your entire codebase
- You can use **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys)** for direct control
- AI providers have their own privacy policies

**With BYOK**:
- Requests go directly from our VMs to AI providers
- No Teta proxy intermediation on AI responses

### Infrastructure Security

**VM Isolation**:
- Each sandbox runs in a **dedicated, isolated VM**
- No shared resources between users, teams or projects
