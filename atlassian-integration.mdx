## What is Atlassian Integration?

The Atlassian integration allows the Teta AI to connect to your Jira and Confluence workspaces. This enables you to:

-  Jira:
    - 📖 **Read issue descriptions**, comments, and acceptance criteria.
    - 💡 **Generate code or prototypes** directly from Jira tickets.
    - 🔄 **Update ticket statuses** and add comments.
    - ✍️ **Create new tickets** and sub-tasks.
- Confluence:
    - 📚 **Read Confluence pages** and documents for context.
    - 🧠 **Answer questions** based on your team's knowledge base.
    - 📝 **Generate documentation** based on your code.

This integration embeds Teta into your Atlassian workflows, improving productivity and ensuring your AI assistant has the context it needs.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create an Atlassian API Token

1.  Log in to your Atlassian account.
2.  Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).
3.  Click **"Create API token"**.
4.  Give the token a descriptive **Label** (e.g., "Teta AI").
5.  Copy the generated token. **You will not be able to see it again.**

### Step 2: Add Token to Teta

1.  In your Teta project, go to **Settings** > **MCPs**.
2.  Click **"Add MCP"**.
3.  Add a name for the secret, for example `server-atlassian`.
4.  Add the following JSON configuration. You will need to provide your Atlassian email and the API token you just created.

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-atlassian"],
  "env": {
    "ATLASSIAN_USERNAME": "$ATLASSIAN_EMAIL",
    "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "$ATLASSIAN_TOKEN",
    "ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL": "https://<your-domain>.atlassian.net"
  }
}
```
5. In the Secrets section, add the following secrets:
    - `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`: Your Atlassian account email.
    - `ATLASSIAN_TOKEN`: The API token you generated.
    - Replace `<your-domain>` with your actual Atlassian domain.

## Configuration Example

**Secret Name**: `server-atlassian`

**Secret Value**:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-atlassian"],
  "env": {
    "ATLASSIAN_USERNAME": "user@example.com",
    "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "<YOUR_ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN>",
    "ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL": "https://example.atlassian.net"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Jira

#### Generate a Prototype from a Jira Ticket

```
You: "Read ticket 'PROJ-456' in Jira and generate a UI for the user profile page."
```

#### Update a Ticket

```
You: "Transition ticket 'PROJ-456' to 'In Progress' and add a comment that work has started."
```

#### Create a New Ticket

```
You: "Create a bug report in the 'PROJ' project titled 'Button is not working on the login page.'"
```

### Confluence

#### Summarize a Confluence Page

```
You: "Summarize the 'Q4 Engineering Roadmap' page in the 'ENG' space in Confluence."
```

#### Answer a Question

```
You: "What is our deployment process, according to the 'Deployment Runbook' in Confluence?"
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use a Service Account

- If possible, create a dedicated service account in Atlassian for Teta.
- This avoids using a personal account and makes it easier to manage permissions.

### 2. Limit Permissions

- When creating the API token, ensure the associated account has the minimum necessary permissions.
- For example, if you only need to read from Confluence, use an account that doesn't have write access.

### 3. Protect Your Token

- Treat your Atlassian API Token as a secret.
- Never commit it directly to your repository.
- Use Teta's secret management to store it securely.

## Conclusion

The Atlassian integration connects Teta to the heart of your project management and documentation, providing the AI with the context to be a more effective member of your team.
