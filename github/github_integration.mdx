4.  **Project Synchronization**: Once the project (new or existing) is connected to a GitHub repository, it will automatically synchronize every time there is a push or pull request in the selected branch.

5.  **Commit and Pull Request**: From the top menu, by clicking the 'Push to GitHub' button, a dialog will open allowing you to choose whether to perform a push with a commit or create a pull request. A pull request is recommended to review changes before accepting them.
