description: "Control which files Teta AI can access using .tetaignore"
---

## **Overview**

Teta reads and indexes your projectâ€™s codebase to power its features.  The .tetaignore system uses gitignore-style patterns to exclude files from processing. It supports basic glob patterns and directory matching.

## Supported Patterns

### Basic Patterns

```markdown
- **filename.txt** - Matches any file named filename.txt anywhere in the project
- ***.log** - Matches all files with .log extension
- **temp?.txt** - Matches temp1.txt, tempA.txt, etc. (? matches single character)
```

### Path-based Patterns

```markdown
- **/config.json** - Matches config.json only in the root directory
- **build/** - Matches any directory named build (trailing slash indicates directory)
- **src/*.dart** - Matches all .dart files directly in src directory
```

### Wildcards

```markdown
- **"*"** - Matches any number of characters (except path separator)
- **?** - Matches exactly one character
```

### Current Limitations

```markdown
- **Negation patterns (!pattern)** are recognized but not implemented
- **Double asterisk (**)** patterns are not supported
- **Complex negation** logic is not handled
- **Character classes ([abc])** are not supported
```

### How It Works

```
1. File paths are converted to relative paths from the base directory
2. Each pattern is tested against the relative path
3. Patterns are converted to regex for matching:
  - . becomes \. (literal dot)
  - * becomes .* (any characters)
  - ? becomes . (single character)
4. Directory patterns (ending with /) use prefix matching
5. Root patterns (starting with /) match from project root only

Examples

# .tetaignore file
*.log          # Ignores all .log files
build/         # Ignores build directory
/config.json   # Ignores config.json in root only
temp?.txt      # Ignores temp1.txt, tempA.txt, etc.
```
