# GitHub Integration Guide

Teta seamlessly integrates with GitHub to provide version control, collaboration, and deployment capabilities for your projects.

## Why GitHub Integration?

GitHub integration is **required** for all Teta projects. This ensures:

- ✅ **Version Control**: Track all changes to your code
- ✅ **Team Collaboration**: Work together with your team
- ✅ **Branch Protection**: Never work directly on main/master
- ✅ **Backup**: Your code is always safe in your repository, never hosted by our side
- ✅ **Deployment**: Easy publishing and continuous deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com))
2. A repository for your project
3. Admin access to the repository

### Initial Setup

#### Step 1: Install Teta GitHub App

1. Go to **Settings** > **GitHub** in your Teta project
2. Click **"Connect GitHub"**
3. You'll be redirected to GitHub
4. Click **"Install"** on the Teta GitHub App
5. Select which repositories to give access to:
   - **All repositories** (easiest)
   - **Only select repositories** (more control)

#### Step 2: Link Repository

1. Return to Teta and start a new session
2. Select your repository from the dropdown
3. Choose the default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Click **"Connect"**

#### Step 3: Initialization

Teta will automatically:

1. Clone your repository
2. Create a working branch (`teta/{feature}-{app}`)
3. Set up the development environment
4. Initialize the workspace

> **Important**: Teta never works directly on your default branch. All changes happen on dedicated working branches.

## How It Works

### Branch Strategy

Teta uses a protective branch strategy:

```
main (or master)           ← Your production code (protected)
  └─ teta/app-abc123       ← Teta's working branch
```

**What happens:**

1. Teta clones your default branch
2. Creates a new branch: `teta/app-[your-app-id]`
3. All AI changes are committed to this working branch
4. You control when to merge back to main

### Workspace Lifecycle

#### On First Connect

```
1. Clone repository from default branch
2. Create working branch (teta/app-*)
3. Push working branch to GitHub
4. Set up development environment
6. Configure AI agents and MCPs
7. Ready to code!
```

## Working with Git

### Committing Changes

The AI will always commits when it edits the code.

Everytime the AI will:
1. Review all changes with `git status` and `git diff`
2. Stage relevant files
3. Create a descriptive commit message
4. Commit to your working branch

### Pushing to GitHub

To push your changes:

```
You: "Push my changes to GitHub"
```

The AI will:
1. Verify there are commits to push
2. Push to your working branch
3. Confirm the push was successful

### Creating Pull Requests

You can create the PR by clicking the button 'Open PR' inside the chat with the AI.
This will redirect you to the review changes page on GitHub, where you can open the PR.

Or you can ask Teta to create a PR:

```
You: "Create a pull request for these changes"
```

The AI will:
1. Review all commits on your branch
2. Generate a comprehensive PR description
3. Create the PR using GitHub CLI (`gh`)
4. Return the PR URL

### Review Before Merging

Always review your working branch before merging to main:

1. Check the diff on GitHub
2. Test the changes thoroughly
3. Get team review if applicable
4. Merge via pull request

## Advanced Features

### Viewing History

To see commit history:

```
You: "Show me the last 10 commits"
```

The AI will display:
- Commit hashes
- Messages
- Authors
- Timestamps

### Rolling Back Changes

To undo commits:

```
You: "Revert the last commit"
```

> **Warning**: Be careful with destructive operations. Always ensure work is backed up.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Can't connect to GitHub

**Solutions**:
1. Check GitHub App is installed
2. Verify repository access
3. Ensure you have admin rights
4. Try reinstalling the GitHub App

### Push Failed

**Problem**: Cannot push to GitHub

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify branch name is correct
3. Ensure you have write access
4. Pull latest changes first

### Merge Conflicts

**Problem**: Cannot merge branches

**Solutions**:
1. Review conflicting files
2. Use `git status` to see conflicts
3. Edit files to resolve conflicts
4. Commit the resolution
5. Ask AI for help if needed

### Lost Connection

**Problem**: GitHub connection lost

**Solutions**:
1. Go to Settings > GitHub
2. Click "Reconnect"
3. Reauthorize the app
4. Verify repository access

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Sensitive Data

Never commit:
- API keys and secrets
- Database passwords
- Private keys
- Environment variables with sensitive data

### Use Environment Variables

For sensitive configuration:

1. Add to **Settings** > **Secrets**
2. Reference in code as environment variables
3. Never hardcode in source files

### Review PRs Carefully

Before merging:
- Check for accidentally committed secrets
- Review all file changes
- Verify tests pass
- Check for security vulnerabilities

## GitHub CLI Integration

Teta uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for advanced features:

### Available Commands

```bash
# View pull requests
gh pr list

# Check PR status
gh pr view 123

# View issues
gh issue list

# Check CI/CD status
gh run list
```

The AI can run these commands for you:

```
You: "Show me all open pull requests"
You: "What's the status of PR #42?"
You: "List the latest CI runs"
```

### From Other Platforms

If migrating from Lovable, FlutterFlow, Claude Code Web:

1. Export your code
2. Create a GitHub repository
3. Push code to GitHub
4. Connect to Teta
5. You're done!

## Conclusion

GitHub integration is central to the Teta development experience. It ensures your code is safe, versioned, and ready for collaboration and deployment.
