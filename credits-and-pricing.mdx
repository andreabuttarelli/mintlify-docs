## How Tokens Work

Teta uses a **token-based system** where AI interactions consume tokens. Tokens represent the amount of text processed by the AI (both input and output).

### Token Consumption

Tokens are consumed when:
- You send a message to the AI
- The AI reads and understands your code
- The AI generates or modifies code
- The AI performs research or analysis
- The AI uses external tools (MCP servers)

Tokens are **not** consumed when:
- Browsing the UI
- Viewing preview
- Using hot reload/restart
- Reading documentation
- Configuring settings

### What Affects Token Usage?

The number of tokens used depends on:
- **Request length**: Longer prompts use more tokens
- **Response length**: More complex code generation uses more tokens
- **Context**: The AI needs to read related code files
- **Iterations**: Multiple back-and-forth messages add up
- **MCP usage**: Accessing external tools may increase token use
- **Agents**: Custom agents may also increase the tokens use

## Pricing Plans

Teta offers flexible pricing tiers to match your development needs.

### Available Plans

**Free (BYOK)** — $0/month
- Bring your own API keys (Claude, Gemini, or GLM)
- Unlimited usage based on your API limits
- No preview access
- Best for developers with existing API keys

**Pro** — $15/month
- 6M tokens (~4,000 AI interactions)
- ~40-60 simple projects or ~15-25 full-stack projects per month
- **~25% less expensive** than Claude Code Pro and Cursor Pro
- **~4x more AI requests** than comparable plans
- Best for individual developers

**Pro+** — $25/month
- 12M tokens (~8,000 AI interactions)
- ~80-110 simple projects or ~30-45 full-stack projects per month
- **~37% less expensive** than Cursor Pro+
- **~3x more AI requests** than comparable plans
- Best for teams & professional developers

**Max** — $99/month
- 50M tokens (~33,000 AI interactions)

## Understanding Token Usage

### How to Monitor Your Usage

Teta provides detailed usage statistics:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Pricing/Subscription**
2. View complete usage stats
3. Track token consumption over the billing period

## Optimizing Token Usage

### 1. Be Specific and Concise

Clear, focused requests use fewer tokens:

❌ **Avoid**:
```
"Can you please take a look at my app and make it better?
I think there might be some issues with the design and maybe
the code could be improved..."
```

✅ **Better**:
```
"Change the login button color to #1E88E5"
```

### 2. Batch Related Changes

Combine multiple small changes into one request:

❌ **Uses more tokens** (3 separate messages):
```
1. "Add a title"
2. "Add a subtitle"
3. "Add a description"
```

✅ **Uses fewer tokens** (1 message):
```
"Add a page header with title, subtitle, and description"
```

### 3. Use Preview Controls First

Before asking the AI:
- Try Hot Reload for UI changes
- Check console for error messages
- Test different device modes

Many issues can be solved without AI assistance!

### 4. Learn from AI Responses

The AI explains its changes. Use this to handle similar tasks yourself next time:

```
AI: "I updated the theme file at lib/theme/colors.dart"

Next time: Edit that file directly instead of asking!
```

### 5. Use AI Agents

Create AI agents for repetitive patterns:
- Define coding standards once
- Agent applies them automatically
- Reduces need for detailed instructions each time
