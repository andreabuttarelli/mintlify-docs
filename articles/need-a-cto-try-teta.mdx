The CTO problem every founder faces

You have a brilliant idea. You've validated the market. You know exactly what needs to be built.

There's just one problem: **you need a CTO**.

And finding one is harder than you thought:

- **Good technical co-founders are rare** - They're already working on their own ideas or commanding high salaries
- **Equity splits are complicated** - Should they get 30%? 40%? What if they leave after 6 months?
- **Hiring is expensive** - Freelance developers cost $50-150/hour, agencies charge $100k+ for an MVP
- **Technical debt accumulates** - Rushed outsourced code often needs complete rewrites
- **Time slips away** - Months spent searching while competitors ship

Meanwhile, your launch date keeps getting pushed back.

Sound familiar?

## What Most Founders Try (And Why It Doesn't Work)

### Option 1: Find a Technical Co-Founder

**The reality:**
- Good CTOs have their own ideas
- Most want equal equity (25-50%)
- Finding the right match takes 6-12 months
- No guarantee they'll stay committed
- Relationship risk is high

**The cost:**
- 6-12 months of searching
- 25-50% of your company
- Ongoing relationship management

### Option 2: Hire Freelance Developers

**The reality:**
- Race to the bottom on quality
- No commitment to your vision
- Communication overhead
- Code quality varies wildly
- Expensive per hour ($50-150/hour)
- Hard to estimate final costs

**The cost:**
- $20k-100k for basic MVP
- Ongoing maintenance costs
- Technical debt accumulation
- Time spent managing contractors

### Option 3: Outsource to an Agency

**The Reality:**
- Professional but expensive
- Minimum $100k for decent MVP
- Long development cycles (3-6 months)
- Lose control of your codebase
- Difficult to iterate quickly
- Vendor lock-in

**The Cost:**
- $100k-500k for MVP
- 3-6 months before launch
- Expensive change requests
- Ongoing maintenance contracts

### Option 4: Learn to Code Yourself

**The Reality:**
- Admirable, but unrealistic timeline
- Takes 6-18 months to be productive
- Still won't match experienced developers
- Takes focus away from business
- Your strength is probably not coding

**The Cost:**
- 6-18 months learning curve
- Opportunity cost of not building business
- Still limited technical capability

## There's a Fifth Option: Teta

What if you could have the **speed of a technical co-founder**, the **quality of an agency**, and the **affordability of outsourcing**—without giving up equity or control?

That's Teta.

### How Teta Works

Teta is an **AI-powered development platform** that acts like your technical team:

**1. You describe what you want to build** (in plain English)
```
"Create a marketplace app where users can list products and buyers can search and filter them"
```

**2. AI writes the code directly into your GitHub repository**
- Follows best practices and coding standards
- Uses modern frameworks (Flutter, React, Svelte)
- Creates proper Git branches and commits
- Generates clean, maintainable code

**3. You see a live preview as it builds**
- Watch your app come to life in real-time
- Test features immediately
- Provide feedback and iterate

**4. Review and deploy when ready**
- All code is in your GitHub repo (you own it 100%)
- Review changes like you would with a developer
- Deploy with one click
- No vendor lock-in

### What Makes Teta Different from "AI Coding Tools"

You've probably heard of **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, or **GitHub Copilot**. They're great—if you're already a developer.

But Teta is different:

| Feature | ChatGPT/Claude | GitHub Copilot | Teta |
|---------|:--------------:|:--------------:|:----:|
| **Non-technical founders can use it** | ❌ (Need to know how to code) | ❌ (Developer tool) | ✅ |
| **Writes directly to your repo** | ❌ (Just gives you code) | ⚠️ (In editor only) | ✅ |
| **Live preview while building** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Multi-framework support** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ (Flutter, React, Svelte) |
| **Cloud development environment** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (Full VS Code in browser) |
| **Deploy with one click** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **No coding knowledge required** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

**The key difference:** Teta is a complete development platform, not just an AI assistant.

## Real Use Cases: When Teta Acts as Your CTO

### Scenario 1: MVP for Fundraising

**Problem:**
You need an MVP to show investors, but you can't afford $100k+ for an agency, and you don't have time to search for a CTO.

**Teta Solution:**
1. **Week 1:** Create project, describe core features to AI
2. **Week 2-3:** AI builds main functionality with your feedback
3. **Week 4:** Polish UI, add animations, prepare demo
4. **Result:** Professional MVP ready to show investors in **under a month**

**Cost with Teta:** ~$200-500 (vs. $100k with agency or 6-12 months finding CTO)

### Scenario 2: SaaS Product Launch

**Problem:**
You've validated your SaaS idea with landing pages and pre-sales. Now you need to build the actual product before customers get frustrated.

**Teta Solution:**
1. Connect your database (via MCP servers)
2. Describe your data model and user workflows
3. AI generates authentication, dashboards, CRUD operations
4. You test and iterate in real-time with live preview
5. Deploy and start onboarding customers

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for V1 (vs. 3-6 months with traditional development)

### Scenario 3: Mobile App for Your Business

**Problem:**
You run a service business (restaurant, gym, salon) and want a mobile app for customers. Agencies quote $50k-150k and 4-6 months.

**Teta Solution:**
1. Choose Flutter (builds iOS, Android, and Web from one codebase)
2. Describe features: booking system, user accounts, notifications, payments
3. AI builds it in weeks with live preview to test on different devices
4. Deploy to app stores when ready

**Cost:** ~$200-500/month vs. $50k+ upfront with agency

### Scenario 4: E-commerce Store with Custom Features

**Problem:**
Shopify/WooCommerce are limited. You need custom features but can't afford a development team.

**Teta Solution:**
1. Build custom e-commerce with React or Svelte
2. AI creates product catalogs, cart, checkout, admin panel
3. Add unique features your competitors don't have
4. Connect to Stripe/payment processors via MCP servers
5. Own the entire codebase (no platform fees)

**Timeline:** 3-6 weeks (vs. 3-6 months with developers)

## What About Technical Quality?

**Concern:** "AI code is messy and low-quality."

**Reality with Teta:**
✅ **Your code lives in GitHub** - Review every change before merging
✅ **AI follows best practices** - Proper architecture, clean code, comments
✅ **Custom AI agents** - Configure coding standards for your project
✅ **Cloud VS Code access** - Edit and refine code yourself (or hire a developer later)
✅ **No vendor lock-in** - Your code is yours, deploy anywhere, switch platforms anytime

Unlike "black box" no-code tools, Teta gives you **real code** you own and control.

## What You Get That a CTO Would Provide

| What CTOs Do | How Teta Delivers It |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Choose tech stack** | Optimized for Flutter, React, Svelte (modern, scalable frameworks) |
| **Write clean code** | AI follows coding standards and best practices |
| **Set up development environment** | Cloud VS Code with all tools pre-configured |
| **Implement features** | AI writes code based on your descriptions |

| **Technical documentation** | AI generates comments and docs |
| **Scale the app** | Cloud infrastructure handles growth automatically |

## Limitations (Let's Be Honest)

Teta isn't a perfect replacement for a CTO in **every scenario**. Here's where it excels and where it has limits:

### Where Teta Excels ✅
- **MVPs and prototypes** - Get to market fast
- **Web apps** (React, Svelte) - Full-featured production apps
- **Cross-platform mobile** (Flutter) - iOS, Android, Web from one codebase
- **SaaS products** - Dashboards, CRUD apps, user management
- **E-commerce** - Custom online stores
- **Internal tools** - Admin panels, data management
- **Rapid iteration** - Test ideas quickly without expensive dev time

### Where You'll Still Need Human Developers 🤝
- **Complex enterprise systems** - Large-scale, multi-year projects
- **Deep platform integrations** - Native iOS/Android features, hardware access
- **Highly specialized domains** - AI/ML models, blockchain, real-time trading systems
- **Custom algorithms** - Complex business logic requiring deep technical expertise
- **Team management** - Leading a technical team (Teta is the team, not the manager)

**The Bottom Line:**
For **80% of startups** building web apps, mobile apps, or SaaS products, Teta can replace the need for a CTO in the early stages.

## Cost Comparison: Teta vs. Traditional Options

| Option | Upfront Cost | Monthly Cost | Time to MVP | Equity Given | Code Ownership |
|--------|:------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| **Technical Co-Founder** | $0 | $0 | 3-6 months | 25-50% | Shared |
| **Freelance Developers** | $20k-100k | $5k-20k | 2-6 months | 0% | Yours |
| **Development Agency** | $100k-500k | $10k+ | 3-9 months | 0% | Yours (usually) |
| **Hire Full-Time CTO** | $30k-50k | $15k-30k | 1-3 months | 5-15% + salary | Shared |
| **Teta** | $0 | $39-299 | 2-6 weeks | 0% | **100% Yours** |

**ROI Example:**
- Agency quote: $150k for MVP (6 months)
- Teta cost: $299/month x 2 months = $598
- **Savings: $149,402** 🎯
