## What Changes for Teta Users?

### 1. 🚀 Dramatically Better Code Generation

**Before (Gemini 2.5 Pro):**
You could ask the AI to build features, and it would produce working code most of the time. Sometimes you'd need to refine prompts or fix issues manually.

**Now (Gemini 3 Pro):**
The AI understands **complex, nuanced instructions** on the first try. It generates production-ready code that handles edge cases, follows best practices, and integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase.

**Real example:**

*Prompt:* "Add authentication to my Flutter app with Google Sign-In, email/password, and password reset. Store user sessions in Supabase. Handle expired tokens gracefully."

**Gemini 2.5 Pro** would implement basic auth but might miss token refresh logic or error states.

**Gemini 3 Pro** implements the full flow correctly, including:
- Proper token refresh handling
- Graceful error states with user-friendly messages
- Secure session management
- Edge cases like network failures during auth

---

### 2. 🎨 "Vibe Coding" — Describe Anything, Get Working UIs

Gemini 3 Pro is the **best vibe coding model** ever built.

**What is vibe coding?**
Instead of writing detailed technical specifications, you describe the *feeling* and *behavior* you want, and the AI generates a complete, interactive UI.

**Example prompts that now work incredibly well:**

- *"Create a product dashboard with a glass morphism aesthetic, real-time charts, and smooth animations"*
- *"Build a meditation timer app with ambient sounds, calm gradients, and gentle haptic feedback"*
- *"Design a pricing table that feels premium but approachable, with subtle hover effects"*

**Gemini 3 Pro ranks #1 on WebDev Arena** specifically for this capability. It doesn't just generate code—it generates **interfaces that feel right**.

---

### 3. 🤖 Agentic Coding: AI That Understands Your Entire Codebase

With its **1 million token context window**, Gemini 3 Pro can:

✅ Understand your entire project structure
✅ Make changes across multiple files consistently
✅ Refactor large codebases without breaking dependencies
✅ Follow your coding conventions automatically

**Terminal-Bench 2.0 score of 54.2%** means it's the best model at **multi-step, agentic coding tasks** like:

- Migrating a React app to Svelte
- Implementing a complex feature that touches backend, frontend, and database
- Debugging errors that span multiple components
- Refactoring legacy code while maintaining functionality

---

### 4. 🧠 Deep Think Mode for Complex Problems

Google introduced **Gemini 3 Deep Think**—an enhanced reasoning mode that pushes performance even further.

**When to use Deep Think:**
- Debugging complex, multi-layered issues
- Architectural decisions ("Should I use Context API or Zustand for state management?")
- Performance optimization challenges
- Algorithm design

Deep Think **spends more time reasoning** before responding, resulting in more thoughtful, comprehensive solutions.

---

### 5. 🎭 Generative UI Responses

Gemini 3 Pro can generate **interactive, visual responses** directly in the chat:

- **Visual layouts**: Magazine-style views with images and modules
- **Dynamic interfaces**: Custom UIs designed in real-time based on your prompt
- **Interactive previews**: See components render before applying them to your project

This makes code review and iteration faster—you can *see* what the AI is building before it writes to your codebase.

## Benchmarks That Matter for Developers

Let's break down what these numbers actually mean for your workflow:

### Coding Intelligence

| Benchmark | Gemini 3 Pro | GPT-5.1 | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | What it measures |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **LiveCodeBench Pro** | **2,439** | 2,243 | 1,418 | Competitive programming (Codeforces, IOI) |
| **Terminal-Bench 2.0** | **54.2%** | 47.6% | 42.8% | Multi-file agentic coding tasks |
| **SWE-bench Verified** | **76.2%** | — | — | Real-world GitHub issue solving |
| **WebDev Arena Elo** | **1,487** | — | — | Vibe coding & UI generation |

**Translation:**
- **LiveCodeBench**: Can solve algorithm problems that would stump most human developers
- **Terminal-Bench**: Can autonomously complete complex coding tasks across multiple files
- **SWE-bench**: Can fix real bugs from real open-source projects
- **WebDev Arena**: Best at turning natural language into beautiful, functional UIs

### Mathematical & Reasoning

| Benchmark | Gemini 3 Pro | GPT-5.1 | Claude Sonnet 4.5 |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **AIME 2025** | **100%** | 94.0% | 100% |
| **MathArena Apex** | **23.4%** | — | — |
| **GPQA Diamond** | **91.9%** | — | — |

**Why this matters for coding:**
Mathematical reasoning = better algorithm design, data structure optimization, and complex logic implementation.

## Multimodal: Beyond Text

Gemini 3 Pro is **the best multimodal AI model in the world**.

### For Teta users, this means:

**1. Image-to-Code**
Upload a screenshot or design mockup, and Gemini 3 Pro generates pixel-perfect code.

**2. Code from Diagrams**
Draw a flow chart or architecture diagram, and get working implementation.

**3. Debugging with Screenshots**
Share an error screenshot or UI bug, and the AI understands the visual context to fix it.

**4. Video Understanding**
Upload a screen recording of user behavior or a bug, and the AI analyzes it to suggest fixes.

## How to Use Gemini 3 Pro on Teta

### Automatic Upgrade (For Most Users)

If you're on **Teta Pro or Ultra**, Gemini 3 Pro is **already available** as your default AI model.

No configuration needed—just start chatting with the AI as usual, and you'll get Gemini 3 Pro's enhanced capabilities.

### Manual Selection

1. Open your Teta project
2. Click on **AI Settings** in the top-right
3. Select **Gemini 3 Pro** from the model dropdown
4. Start building 🚀

### Pricing

Gemini 3 Pro uses the same credit system as other models:

- **Input**: 0.1 credits per 1K tokens
- **Output**: 0.3 credits per 1K tokens

The performance gains often **save credits** because you need fewer iterations to get working code.

## Real-World Impact: What Developers Are Saying

**From our beta testers:**

> *"The difference is night and day. Prompts that used to take 3-4 iterations now work perfectly on the first try."*
> — Sarah K., Full-Stack Developer

> *"I described a complex admin dashboard in plain English, and Gemini 3 Pro generated a production-ready React app with routing, state management, and API integration. I barely touched the code."*
> — Marcus T., Startup Founder

> *"The agentic coding is unreal. I asked it to migrate my React app to Svelte, and it handled every file, every component, every state hook. It even updated my tests."*
> — Priya M., Frontend Engineer

## Gemini 3 Pro vs. Other Models: When to Use What

Not every task requires the most powerful model. Here's a quick guide:

### Use Gemini 3 Pro for:

✅ Complex, multi-file features
✅ Architectural refactoring
✅ Vibe coding / UI generation
✅ Algorithm & data structure design
✅ Debugging tricky, multi-layered issues
✅ Multimodal tasks (image/video to code)

### Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for:

## Performance Tips: Getting the Most from Gemini 3 Pro

### 1. **Be Specific, But Not Over-Prescriptive**

**Good prompt:**
*"Create a user profile page with avatar upload, bio editing, and social links. Use a modern card layout with smooth transitions."*

**Over-prescriptive prompt:**
*"Create a div with className 'profile-container' and inside it create another div with className 'avatar-wrapper'..."*

Gemini 3 Pro excels when you describe **what** you want, not **how** to build it.

### 2. **Use Deep Think for Hard Problems**

For complex debugging or architectural decisions, explicitly ask:
*"Use Deep Think mode to analyze this performance issue"*

### 3. **Leverage Multimodal Input**

Instead of describing a UI in words, upload a screenshot or sketch. Gemini 3 Pro will understand it better than a text description.

### 4. **Let It See Your Whole Codebase**

With 1M token context, you can ask:
*"Review my entire project and suggest performance optimizations"*

It'll analyze everything and provide comprehensive insights.
